@bilhary2148,2024-12-13T17:31:09Z,2024-12-13T17:31:09Z,0,Nowadays one plus over price going on top not worth 😏😏😏😏
@yatheeshchandra718,2024-12-13T14:15:48Z,2024-12-13T14:15:48Z,1,OnePlus is making a joke of itself by not opting for a global release amd going for a China first release. Global release coming after few month. Why so much hype for a Chinese phone ? Maybe its time for a new brand to beat the hype.

@murtazafahim4960,2024-12-13T03:44:21Z,2024-12-13T03:44:21Z,0,"Hey guys! Same here using my OnePlus 7 Pro to this day. Bought it the same year it launched. Have the Almond color one 😁. But I have some cons to share 😢 starting with the display, tbh one of the best displays of all time to this day! But still my display is kinda cooked now. Like where the wifi indicator and battery percentage shows, that spot on my screen is etched 😢. Having no more updates is sad. Also my phone hangs sometimes when charging is low, I wouldn&#39;t say it hangs but it&#39;s kinda worse than that. Like when my phone is low on battery and for example I open a third party app like Snapchat or Whatsapp and open their camera. My phone just stops there. And I can&#39;t do anything about it, it just restarts and I have to charge it asap or I&#39;ll hang like that again. Well I think it&#39;s time for an update 😅. Thinking of buying the new OnePlus Nord 4 or OnePlus 12r. Both are great for the money tbh. But having trouble choosing 😂. Well,.... If you read this, a recommendation would be great. ❤️"

@zakuinabox3992,2024-12-04T00:06:26Z,2024-12-04T00:06:26Z,0,Wondering what the price is gonna be and storage options line up with each price bracket. I have the 12 Emerald and while i live it man did i want the white version. Glad to see its coming state side and im hoping a good trade deal is on offer for the 12 going into the 13 as I&#39;m really on the fence. That and youll get me to buy the buds pro 3 if its good XD

@trashacc7124,2024-12-03T10:46:33Z,2024-12-03T10:46:33Z,2,Kinda like the curve screen more because it looks like having big screen with small size and has more advantage when gaming

@JD-vh4hl,2024-12-03T10:20:59Z,2024-12-03T10:20:59Z,773,OnePlus 7 Pro (with true infinite display) was the next chapter. All models with that front camera on the screen - is the previous chapter. Bring back a true infinite display! It is already 5 years that I&#39;ve been using OP7Pro and I am happy with it.
